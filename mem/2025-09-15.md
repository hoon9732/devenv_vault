## Conversation Summary for 2025-09-15

- Confirmed the existence of `2025-09-12.md` in the `mem` folder.
- Discussed adding a command to summarize daily conversations.
- Initially, `/mem` was proposed, but it conflicted with an existing command.
- Subsequently, `/sum` was proposed, which also conflicted.
- `/diary` was then proposed and successfully added to memory as the command to save the conversation record.
- The user manually updated the `GEMINI.md` file and requested that `#mem` be the new command for saving the conversation record.
- I updated my memory to recognize `#mem` as the command to save the entire conversation record for the day.
