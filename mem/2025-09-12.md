# Gemini CLI Interaction Summary - 2025-09-12

- **Memory & Context:** User inquired about my memory of past conversations. I clarified that my memory is based on the initial context from `GEMINI.md` and facts saved with the `save_memory` tool, not a transcript of previous chats.
- **`GEMINI.md` File:** I identified the location of the `GEMINI.md` file based on the startup context.
- **`save_memory` Tool Test:**
    - User asked to test the `save_memory` function. I saved the fact: "The user wants to test if I can save our current interaction as a memory."
    - User then asked to remove this memory.
    - I attempted to read and rewrite the `GEMINI.md` file to remove the line, but was blocked by a security restriction preventing access outside the `C:\Users\USER\Documents\code` workspace.
- **New Strategy (This Request):** User proposed saving interaction summaries to a local `.md` file within the workspace (`C:\Users\USER\Documents\code\memory`) to create a loadable memory for future sessions.
