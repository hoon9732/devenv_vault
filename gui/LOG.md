This is an excellent and well-thought-out plan. You have a clear vision for the application's architecture and user experience, which is the most important first step. Your analogy to Photoshop's "dock" and widget system is a very strong one for this type of specialized editor.

Based on your goal, current state, and limitations, here is my opinion and guidance on your next steps, focusing on the high-level strategy as you requested.

### Overarching Recommendation: Data Model First

Your most critical task right now is to **define your data structure**. Everything else—the diagram view, the sheet view, the file saving—is just a representation or manipulation of this core data model. If you get the data model right, the rest of the application will fall into place much more smoothly. This model will be the "single source of truth" you mentioned.

Here is a suggested sequence of steps to move forward from where you are.

### Step 1: Define the Core Data Schema in JSON

Before you build any more UI, decide on the exact structure of your project data. Since you're in a Node.js environment, **JSON is the natural and recommended choice** over XML. It's native to JavaScript, requires no external parsers, and is generally more lightweight.

Think about what a `.icd` project file will contain. A good starting point for your JSON schema would be an object with three main keys:

1.  **`metadata`**: An object for project-level information (e.g., `projectName`, `author`, `version`, `creationDate`, `description`). This corresponds to your "Docs" view.
2.  **`nodes`**: An array of objects. Each object represents a single block or element in your diagram.
    *   Each node must have a unique `id`.
    *   It needs positional data (e.g., `position: { x: 100, y: 150 }`).
    *   Crucially, it needs a `properties` object. This can be a flexible key-value store, allowing for the "unlimited properties" you described. Nested objects within `properties` can handle the sub-properties.
3.  **`links`**: An array of objects. Each object represents a connection between two nodes.
    *   Each link must have a unique `id`.
    *   It needs to reference the nodes it connects (e.g., `source: "node_id_1"`, `target: "node_id_2"`).
    *   It should also have its own `properties` object for things like signal ID, voltage, etc.

**Actionable Start:** Create a sample `my_project.json` file by hand in Notepad++. Manually define a simple system with 2-3 nodes and 1-2 links connecting them. This file will be your test case for the next steps.

### Step 2: Create a "Headless" Project Manager

Create a separate JavaScript module (e.g., `services/ProjectManager.js`) that is completely independent of your React UI. This module's only job is to manage the project data object.

This "manager" should have functions like:
*   `loadProject(jsonData)`: Takes the content of a JSON file and stores it in memory.
*   `getProject()`: Returns the current project data.
*   `addNode(nodeData)`: Adds a new node to the `nodes` array.
*   `updateNode(nodeId, updatedProperties)`: Updates the properties of a specific node.
*   `addLink(linkData)`: Adds a new link to the `links` array.
*   `exportProject()`: Returns the current project data as a JSON string, ready to be saved.

By separating this logic, you make your application robust. Your UI components will just call these functions; they won't manipulate the data directly.

### Step 3: Integrate the Data Model with React

Now, you can connect your data model to your UI.

1.  **State Management:** Use React's Context API to hold the project data. A `ProjectContext` can provide the entire project object to any component that needs it. When the data is updated (by calling a function from your `ProjectManager`), the context updates, and all components re-render automatically.
2.  **Load/Save Functionality:** Implement the basic file operations. Use Node.js's `fs` module (accessible through your Electron `preload.js` script) to create functions for reading a `.json` file from the file explorer and saving your project data back to a file. This will make your application feel real immediately.

### Step 4: Build the Views as "Renderers" of the Data

With the data management in place, building the different views becomes much more straightforward.

*   **For the Diagram View:** Look into a dedicated diagramming library that you can integrate with React. **React Flow** is an extremely popular and powerful choice for this. It is designed to render nodes and edges from data arrays, exactly like the schema you defined. It handles dragging, connecting, panning, and zooming out of the box. You would simply feed it the `nodes` and `links` from your `ProjectContext`.
*   **For the Sheet View:** This view would also read from the `nodes` and `links` in your `ProjectContext`. It would iterate through them and display their `properties` in a table. When a user edits a cell in the table, it would call the appropriate `updateNode` or `updateLink` function, which in turn updates the central data model, and the Diagram view would update automatically. You mentioned Blueprint.js, which is a great choice for this.

### Summary of Your Immediate Path Forward:

1.  **Finalize v1 of your JSON data schema.** Write a sample file by hand.
2.  **Build a non-UI JavaScript module** to handle creating, reading, and modifying this data structure.
3.  **Create a React Context** to hold the project data and make it available to all your components.
4.  **Implement basic file I/O:** Wire up the "Open" button to read your sample JSON file into the context and a "Save" button to write it back out.
5.  **Start on the Diagram View:** Integrate a library like React Flow to render a visual representation of the data from your context.

By focusing on the data structure first, you are building a solid foundation. This approach ensures that all parts of your application are working with a single, reliable source of truth, which is the core principle of the MBSE tools you admire.
