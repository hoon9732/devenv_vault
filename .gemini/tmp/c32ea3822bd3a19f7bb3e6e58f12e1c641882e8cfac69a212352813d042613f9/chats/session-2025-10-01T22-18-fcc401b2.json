      "content": "Last time, we left off where the about.html has the broken version of svg file. Also, the UI scaling option was not seemingly implemented in the UI of the about.html window. Here are the three goals.\n1. Replace the currently broken svg image in about.html with @Hanwha_Aerospace_Logo.svg , which appears black in light theme, and white in dark theme.\n2. Make UI scaling apply to the page. This should not change text size, but scale the titlebar size accordingly.\n3. The titlebar should also be properly colored accordng to theme.\n--- Content from referenced files ---\nContent from @C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code\\gui\\Hanwha_Aerospace_Logo.svg:\n<?xml

I'll assume `document:code` was a slight misremembering and that `document-share` is the intended icon, as it's a valid BlueprintJS icon name that fits the context. If this is wrong, the user can correct me.\n    *   In `mainNavItems`, swap the positions of the \"Search\" and \"Explorer\" items.\n2.  **Rename `FlowchartScreen.js`**: I'll rename `src/pages/FlowchartScreen.js` to `src/pages/GraphsScreen.js`.\n3.  **Modify the content of the newly named `GraphsScreen.js`**: I'll replace all occurrences of \"Flowchart\" with \"Graphs\" inside the file.\n4.  **Update `App.js`**: I'll update the import for `GraphsScreen` and change the route from `/flowchart` to `/graphs`.\n\nI'll start by modifying `Sidebar.js`.",

The goal is to make the hamburger button area, the Explorer top bar, and the PageTopbar all share the same height and background color, which will change with the theme.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1.  **Centralize Colors**: I'll define the top bar colors directly within the main theme object in `App.js`. This will create a single source of truth for the colors.\n2.  **Update `PageTopbar`**: I'll modify the `PageTopbar` to get its background color from the theme object instead of its own CSS.\n3.  **Update `Explorer.js`**: I'll read `Explorer.js` and modify its top bar to match the height (`40px`) and background color of the `PageTopbar`.\n4.  **Update `Sidebar.js`**: I'll adjust the hamburger button's container to match the new height and background color.\n\nI'll start by reading `Explorer.js` and `PageTopbar.css` to understand their current structure.",

I will also add a new listener so the button colors can be updated in real-time if you change the theme while the app is running.\n2.  **Update `preload.js`**: I will expose the new theme update function to the renderer process.\n3.  **Update `App.js`**: I will call the new function from the theme-changing `useEffect` hook to notify the main process of theme changes.\n4.  **Update `TitleBar.js` and `TitleBar.css`**: I will modify the component to get its text color from the theme, ensuring it's always visible, and remove the hardcoded color from the CSS.\n\nI'll start by modifying `main.js`.",

The draggable overlay essentially \"steals\" the mouse events, so the native buttons never register the hover.\n\nThe close button likely works because it's at the very edge, and the expanding title `div` isn't quite reaching it.\n\nTo fix this, I will add a non-draggable, empty placeholder `div` to the right side of the title bar.

This is a known, tricky issue that happens sometimes when using the BlueprintJS library with `create-react-app`.\n\nHere's what's happening:\n1.  The BlueprintJS icon CSS file (`blueprint-icons.css`) refers to font and SVG files using relative paths (e.g., `url('./blueprint-icons-16.svg')`).\n2.  When you import that CSS file into your project, `create-react-app`'s underlying build system (Webpack) tries to be smart and resolve that path.\n3.  However, due to how it processes files from `node_modules`, it fails to find the SVG file, leading to the \"Module not found\" error.\n\nThe solution is to bypass Webpack's path resolution for these specific files. We can do this by:\n1.  Copying the necessary icon resources (fonts and SVGs) into your `public` folder.\n2.  Creating a local copy of the Blueprint icon CSS that points to these public files.\n3.  Importing our local CSS file instead of the one from the library.\n\nI will perform these steps now. First, I'll create the necessary directories and copy the icon resources.",

This process can be very sensitive.\n\nThe most likely trigger was when I moved the `className={`${themeMode}-theme`}` in `App.js`. While it seems like a small change, altering the structure of the main component can sometimes change the order or context in which CSS files are processed by the build system. This can expose underlying configuration issues that weren't previously causing a crash.\n\nThe standard and most robust way to fix this, and to prevent it from happening again, is to explicitly import the main Blueprint CSS file at the very top level of your application. This ensures all of Blueprint's assets are loaded correctly every time.\n\nI will add the required import to `src/index.js`.

          "description": "I've been analyzing the recent changes, particularly the addition of the `electron:prod` script and my modifications to `App.js` and `TitleBar.css`. I suspect the root cause is the main Blueprint CSS import in the project's entry point, which I haven't examined yet. My hypothesis is that this import is missing, leading to the \"Module not found\" error. I am ready to confirm the existence of this file.",

          "description": "My current focus is on the `src/index.js` file, which is likely the project's main entry point. I suspect the core Blueprint CSS import is missing from it. The root cause is likely an absent import in the entry point, or a misconfiguration that disrupted the original Blueprint JS setup. I'll read this file to determine what needs fixing. I need to be more thorough, as it seems there are missing details in this process.",

My apologies.\n\nThe fact that the imports are present but the build is still failing points to a more subtle issue, likely related to the version of `react-scripts` and how it interacts with the version of BlueprintJS you have installed.\n\nI will now revert the change I made to `App.js` that moved the `className`. This was the most likely trigger, and reverting it should restore the previous working state. My apologies for not trying this first.",
