Icon blurring at small sizes is often due to sub-pixel rendering issues when an icon is scaled to a size it wasn't designed for.\n\nBlueprintJS icons are designed to be crisp at specific sizes, typically **16px** and **20px**. We're already using `16`, which is good.\n\nTo combat the blurring, we can try a couple of things:\n\n1.  **Explicitly set the icon size via CSS:** Instead of relying solely on the `size` prop, we can set a `font-size` on the icon's container. Blueprint icons are font-based, so this can give us more direct control over their rendering.\n2.  **Use a different `icon`:** Sometimes, specific icons have better hinting for smaller sizes. For files, `document` is standard, but for folders, `folder-open` might render more cleanly than `folder-close` when small, due to having more negative space.\n\nLet's try the first approach, as it's the most direct. I'll modify `TreeView.js` to apply a specific `font-size` to the `ListItemIcon` that wraps the Blueprint icon. This often helps the browser render the icon font more crisply.",

      "content": "That is an excellent and very specific observation. You're right, and it points directly to the cause.\n\nThe blurring happens because the nested items (the \"subtree\") are inside a Material-UI `<Collapse>` component. To create the smooth open/close animation, this component uses CSS transforms. When an element is being transformed, browsers (including the one in Electron) can switch to a different, less precise anti-aliasing method to improve animation performance, which results in that slight blur on small, detailed shapes like icons.\n\nThe fix is to give the browser a hint to prioritize rendering quality for that specific element, even during a transform. I'll add a couple of CSS properties to the `ListItemIcon` that wraps the icon to force a crisper rendering mode.\n\nI will modify `TreeView.js` to apply these styles.",

The lack of change and the slight movement are indeed related, and you're right to suspect an animation issue.\n\nHere's the diagnosis:\n1.  **The Movement:** Material-UI's `Tooltip` has a default \"grow\" animation. When it appears, it quickly scales up and fades in. This animation is causing the flickering/movement you're seeing.\n2.  **The Distance:** The animation was also interfering with my previous attempts to change the distance. The negative margin was likely being overridden or miscalculated during the transition.\n\nThe correct solution is to disable the animation entirely and use the Tooltip's built-in positioning system (`Popper.js`) to set a precise, small offset.\n\nFirst, I'll fix this in the primary sidebar (`Sidebar.js`). I'll remove the negative margin logic and replace it with props that disable the animation and set a very small distance.",

Make the titlebar appear with 'app title' 'version', so as 'ICDV 0.0.1' FOr example. Any text saying icdv 0.1.0(wrong version name) should be revised to 0.0.1\n4.
