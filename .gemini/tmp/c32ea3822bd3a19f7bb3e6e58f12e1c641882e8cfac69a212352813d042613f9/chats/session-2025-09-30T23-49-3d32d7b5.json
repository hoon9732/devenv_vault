Here's the plan:\n\n**Step 1: Modify `Topbar.js`**\n*   Remove the `IconButton` containing the `MenuIcon`.\n*   Remove the `handleDrawerToggle` and `open` props, as they are no longer needed.\n*   Remove the vertical `Divider` that shifts with the sidebar.\n*   The `AppBar`'s `position` will need to change from `absolute` to `relative` or `static` to fit into the new layout flow in `App.js`.\n\n**Step 2: Modify `Sidebar.js`**\n*   Add the `handleDrawerToggle` prop.\n*   Add a new section at the top for the hamburger button. I'll use a `Toolbar` to align it nicely and then a `Divider`.\n*   The `Drawer` component in `Sidebar.js` already has a high `z-index`, so it should naturally sit on top of the `Topbar` once the layout in `App.js` is corrected.\n\n**Step 3: Modify `App.js`**\n*   Change the main layout structure. I'll have a root `Box` with `display: 'flex'`. Inside, the `Sidebar` will be first, followed by a new `Box` that contains the `Topbar` and the main content area, stacked vertically.\n*   Pass the `handleDrawerToggle` prop to `Sidebar` instead of `Topbar`.\n*   Remove the `open` prop from `Topbar`.\n\nI will now start with Step 1 and modify `Topbar.js`.",
