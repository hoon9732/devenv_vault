This allows you to load the summary as context in future sessions, giving me a \"memory\" of our work. We also attempted to test the `save_memory` tool, but ran into a security restriction.",

My functionality is based on the tools I have available, such as reading and writing files, and running shell commands.\n\nThe method we've established—where we create a summary and I use my `write_file` tool to save it to `memory/2025-09-12.md`—is the correct way to create a memory of our interaction for me to recall later.\n\nThe `/chat` command seems like it might be a feature of the Gemini CLI application you are using, but it is separate from my own capabilities.",
