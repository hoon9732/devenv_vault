      "content": "The output of `echo %PATH%` confirms that `C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin` is not present in the PATH variable of your current Git Bash environment.\n\nThe reason `gcc` works in the MSYS2 UCRT64 console is that MSYS2 sets up its own environment, including the PATH, when you launch its console. Git Bash, on the other hand, uses its own environment, which doesn't automatically include the MSYS2 paths unless you explicitly add them to your system's PATH variable or to Git Bash's configuration.\n\nTo fix this, you need to ensure `C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin` is correctly added to your system's PATH variable, and then **restart your Git Bash console** (or any other console where you want `gcc` to be available) for the changes to take effect.\n\nHere's how you can typically add it to your system's PATH on Windows:\n\n1.  **Search for \"Environment Variables\"**: In the Windows search bar, type \"environment variables\" and select \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n2.  **Open Environment Variables**: In the System Properties window, click the \"Environment Variables...\" button.\n3.  **Edit System PATH**: Under \"System variables\", find the \"Path\" variable and select it, then click \"Edit...\".\n4.  **Add New Path**: Click \"New\" and add `C:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin`.\n5.  **Move Up (Optional but Recommended)**: Move this new entry up in the list to give it higher precedence, especially above any other `mingw` or `gcc` related paths that might be conflicting.\n6.  **Confirm Changes**: Click \"OK\" on all open windows to save the changes.\n7.  **Restart Console**: Close your current Git Bash console and open a new one. Then, try `gcc --version` again.\n\nIf you've already done these steps and it's still not working, there might be a typo in the path you added, or the changes haven't propagated correctly. Double-check the path in the environment variables editor.",
