Open your terminal in the `C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code\\blueprint-gui` directory.\n2.  Run `npm run electron-dev`. This will start the React development server and then launch the Electron application.\n\nPlease note that the `SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN` error during Electron installation might still be an issue. If you encounter problems running the application, you may need to address that network configuration issue first.\n\nLet me know if you'd like to proceed with adding more features or refining the layout.",

It's likely used for conditional compilation, where certain debug-related code blocks might be included or excluded based on whether this macro is defined.\n*   **`#include <timers.h>`**: Includes the header for POSIX timers, providing functions like `timer_create`, `timer_settime`, `timer_cancel`, and `timer_delete`.\n*   **`#include <tickLib.h>`**: Includes a library likely related to system ticks or timekeeping, possibly from a real-time operating system (RTOS) like VxWorks, given the `_Vx_usr_arg_t` type seen later. `tickGet()` is used later.\n*   **`#include <stdio.h>`**: Standard C input/output library, used for functions like `printf` and `LOGMSG` (which likely wraps `printf` or a similar logging mechanism).\n*   **`#include \"../drv/...\"`**: These include header files from the `drv` (driver) directory. They likely provide interfaces to interact with specific hardware components:\n    *   `axiDio.h`: Digital Input/Output (DIO) via an AXI bus.\n    *   `axiAdc.h`: Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) via an AXI bus.\n    *   `axiSdlc.h`: Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) via an AXI bus.\n*   **`#include \"../lib/...\"`**: These include header files from the `lib` (library) directory, providing utility and control functions:\n    *   `isDebug.h`: Likely contains functions or macros to check debug status.\n    *   `mtsLibPsCtrl.h`: Power supply control library.\n    *   `steLib.h`: Another system-specific library.\n*   **`#include \"...\"`**: These include header files from the current application directory:\n    *   `common.h`: Common definitions for the application.\n    *   `Monitoring.h`: The header file for this `Monitoring.c` module, containing declarations for its public functions and data structures.\n    *   `LogSend.h`: For sending log messages.\n    *   `UdpRecvRs1.h`, `UdpRecvRs4.h`: For receiving UDP data, possibly related to specific communication channels (RS1, RS4).\n\n**C Aspects Used**:\n*   Preprocessor directives (`#define`, `#include`).\n*   Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`).\n*   System-specific libraries (timers, tickLib, and custom drivers/libraries).\n\n### Block 2: Macros for Configuration and `MonitoringState` Enum\n\n```c\n#define MONITORING_MSG_Q_LEN\t(20)\n#define MONITORING_PERIOD_SEC\t(0)\n#define MONITORING_PREIOD_NS\t(20000000)\n#define MONITORING_OFFSET_SEC\tMONITORING_PERIOD_SEC\n#define MONITORING_OFFSET_NS\tMONITORING_PERIOD_NS\n\ntypedef enum {\n\tRUNNING,\n\tSTOP\n} MonitoringState;\n```\n\n*   **`#define MONITORING_MSG_Q_LEN (20)`**: Defines the maximum number of messages the monitoring task's message queue can hold.\n*   **`#define MONITORING_PERIOD_SEC (0)`**: Defines the seconds component of the monitoring period.\n*   **`#define MONITORING_PREIOD_NS (20000000)`**: Defines the nanoseconds component of the monitoring period. `20,000,000 ns` is `20 ms`. This means the monitoring task will execute approximately every 20 milliseconds.\n*   **`#define MONITORING_OFFSET_SEC MONITORING_PERIOD_SEC`**: Defines the initial offset (seconds) for the timer.\n*   **`#define MONITORING_OFFSET_NS MONITORING_PERIOD_NS`**: Defines the initial offset (nanoseconds) for the timer. The offset being the same as the period means the timer will fire immediately and then periodically.\n*   **`typedef enum { RUNNING, STOP } MonitoringState;`**: Defines an enumeration `MonitoringState` with two possible values: `RUNNING` and `STOP`. This is used to track the current state of the monitoring task.\n\n**C Aspects Used**:\n*   Preprocessor directives (`#define`) for constants.\n*   `typedef enum` for creating a custom enumeration type.\n\n### Block 3: `MonitoringInst` Structure\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n\tTASK_ID\t\t\ttaskId;\n\tModuleType\t\tipcType;\n\tunion {\n\t\tMSG_Q_ID\tmsgQId;\n\t\tint\t\t\tpipeFd;\n\t\tint\t\t\tquitFlag;\n\t} ipcObj;\n\tchar\t\t\tdeferredWorkName[32];\n#ifdef USE_CHK_TASK_STATUS\n\tTaskStatus *\ttaskStatus;\n#endif\n\tMonitoringState state;\n\ttimer_t\t\t\ttimerId;\n} MonitoringInst;\n```\n\n*   **`typedef struct { ... } MonitoringInst;`**: Defines a structure `MonitoringInst` which encapsulates all the data related to a monitoring instance. This is a common pattern in C to achieve object-like behavior.\n    *   **`TASK_ID taskId;`**: A unique identifier for the task (thread or process) associated with this monitoring instance.\n    *   **`ModuleType ipcType;`**: Specifies the type of Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanism used (e.g., message queue, pipe).\n    *   **`union { ... } ipcObj;`**: A `union` allows different members to share the same memory location. This is used here to store the specific IPC object ID based on `ipcType`.\n        *   **`MSG_Q_ID msgQId;`**: Message queue ID, if `ipcType` is a message queue.\n        *   **`int pipeFd;`**: Pipe file descriptor, if `ipcType` is a pipe.\n        *   **`int quitFlag;`**: A flag to signal termination, possibly for other IPC types or direct control.\n    *   **`char deferredWorkName[32];`**: A character array to store the name of any deferred work.\n    *   **`#ifdef USE_CHK_TASK_STATUS ... #endif`**: This is a conditional compilation block. If `USE_CHK_TASK_STATUS` is defined, a pointer to a `TaskStatus` structure (`taskStatus`) will be included. This is for monitoring the status of the task itself.\n    *   **`MonitoringState state;`**: Stores the current state of the monitoring instance (RUNNING or STOP).\n    *   **`timer_t timerId;`**: The ID of the POSIX timer used to trigger periodic monitoring actions.\n\n**C Aspects Used**:\n*   `typedef struct` for defining custom data structures.\n*   `union` for memory-efficient storage of mutually exclusive data.\n*   Conditional compilation (`#ifdef`, `#endif`).\n\n### Block 4: Global Variables\n\n```c\nLOCAL MonitoringInst g_stMonitoringInst = {\n\tTASK_ID_ERROR, MSGQ, {MSG_Q_ID_NULL}, \"\",\n};\nLOCAL struct itimerspec g_stMonitoringTimer = {\n\t{MONITORING_PERIOD_SEC, MONITORING_PERIOD_NS},\n\t{MONITORING_OFFSET_SEC, MONITORING_OFFSET_NS},\n};\n\nLOCAL LOG_DATA g_stMonitoringLog;\nLOCAL TM_COMM_STS g_tmCommSts = {0,};\n\nconst ModuleInst *g_hMonitoring = (ModuleInst *)&g_stMonitoringInst;\n\nTM_COMM_STS * g_pTmCommSts = &g_tmCommSts;\n```\n\n*   **`LOCAL MonitoringInst g_stMonitoringInst = { ... };`**: Declares and initializes a global instance of the `MonitoringInst` structure.\n    *   `LOCAL` is likely a macro (e.g., `#define LOCAL static`) making the variable have internal linkage, meaning it's only visible within this `.c` file.\n    *   It's initialized with `TASK_ID_ERROR`, `MSGQ` (indicating message queue IPC), a null message queue ID, and an empty string for `deferredWorkName`.\n*   **`LOCAL struct itimerspec g_stMonitoringTimer = { ... };`**: Declares and initializes a global `itimerspec` structure, which defines the timer's period and initial expiration. It uses the `MONITORING_PERIOD_SEC/NS` and `MONITORING_OFFSET_SEC/NS` macros defined earlier.\n*   **`LOCAL LOG_DATA g_stMonitoringLog;`**: Declares a global variable `g_stMonitoringLog` of type `LOG_DATA`, which will be used to store monitoring log information before sending.\n*   **`LOCAL TM_COMM_STS g_tmCommSts = {0,};`**: Declares and initializes a global variable `g_tmCommSts` of type `TM_COMM_STS` (Telemetry Communication Status) to all zeros. This structure likely holds various communication statistics.\n*   **`const ModuleInst *g_hMonitoring = (ModuleInst *)&g_stMonitoringInst;`**: Declares a global constant pointer `g_hMonitoring` of type `ModuleInst *` and initializes it to point to `g_stMonitoringInst`. This provides a generic handle to the monitoring module, possibly for use by other modules that interact with it.

It uses message queues for inter-task communication, POSIX timers for scheduling, and interacts with various hardware drivers (DIO, ADC, SDLC) to collect system status and sensor data. This data is then formatted into log messages and sent for further processing. The `mtsShowTmCommSts` function provides a way to inspect communication statistics. The code heavily relies on C language features such as structures, unions, pointers, preprocessor directives, and system-level programming constructs.\n--- End of content ---"
