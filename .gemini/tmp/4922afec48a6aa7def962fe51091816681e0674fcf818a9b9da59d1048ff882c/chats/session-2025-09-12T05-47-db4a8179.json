We can definitely set up a system to back up your workspace to GitHub and restore it, but full automation will have some limitations and security considerations due to the wipeouts.\n\nHere's a detailed plan, including compromised options where full automation isn't feasible:\n\n**Phase 1: Initial GitHub Repository Setup and First Backup**\n\n1.  **Initialize Git in your workspace:** We'll start by making your `C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code` directory a Git repository.\n2.  **Create a GitHub Repository:** You'll need a new, empty repository on your personal GitHub page.\n3.  **Link Local to GitHub:** Connect your local Git repository to the one on GitHub.\n4.  **Perform Initial Push:** Upload your current workspace content to GitHub.\n\n**Phase 2: Automating Backups (Pushing Changes)**\n\n1.  **Secure Authentication:** We'll set up SSH keys for secure authentication with GitHub, as storing credentials directly in scripts is risky, especially with frequent wipeouts.\n2.  **Scheduled Task for Push:** We'll create a simple script and schedule it to run periodically to push your changes.\n\n**Phase 3: Automating Restoration (Cloning on Reboot)**\n\n1.  **Startup Script for Clone:** We'll create a script that clones your repository and place it in your Windows Startup folder.\n\nLet's start with Phase 1. First, I'll check if Git is already initialized in your `C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code` directory.\n\n",

This strongly indicates a network or firewall issue preventing SSH connections to GitHub on port 22.\n\n**Compromised Option for Backups (if SSH cannot be resolved):**\n\nIf we cannot establish an SSH connection, the most reliable alternative for automated backups, given your PC wipeouts, would be to use **HTTPS with a Personal Access Token (PAT)**.\n\n**Why PAT over SSH if SSH is preferred?**\n*   **Reliability:** HTTPS connections are less likely to be blocked by firewalls than SSH.\n*   **Automation:** A PAT can be stored and used in scripts without manual interaction.\n*   **Security (with caveats):** While storing a PAT directly in a script is generally discouraged, given your PC wipeouts, it's a pragmatic compromise. The PAT would be wiped with your PC, reducing the long-term risk of it being compromised. You would need to regenerate it after each wipeout, or store it in a secure, non-wiped location (which we don't have in this scenario).\n\n**Steps for using HTTPS with a PAT:**\n\n1.  **Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub:**\n    *   Go to GitHub.com, click your profile photo (top right), then click \"Settings\".\n    *   In the left sidebar, click \"Developer settings\" -> \"Personal access tokens\" -> \"Tokens (classic)\".\n    *   Click \"Generate new token\" -> \"Generate new token (classic)\".\n    *   For \"Note\", add a descriptive label (e.g., \"Devenv Vault Backup Token\").\n    *   Set an \"Expiration\" (e.g., 90 days, or custom if you prefer).\n    *   **Crucially, select the `repo` scope.** This grants the token permission to access your repositories.\n    *   Click \"Generate token\".\n    *   **Copy the generated token immediately.** You will not be able to see it again.\n\n2.  **Update Git Remote URL to HTTPS:** We'll change the remote URL back to HTTPS.\n\n3.  **Create a Backup Script:** We'll create a simple batch script that performs `git add .`, `git commit`, and `git push`. The PAT will be used in the push command.\n\n**Before we proceed with the PAT option, would you like to try troubleshooting the SSH connection further?** This might involve checking your firewall settings or trying to connect from a different network if possible. If you prefer to move forward with the PAT, please let me know, and provide the generated PAT.",

      "content": "The `backup.bat` script has been created in your workspace.\n\nNow, you need to set up a scheduled task in Windows to run this script regularly. Here are the steps:\n\n1.  **Open Task Scheduler:**\n    *   Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press Enter.\n    *   Alternatively, search for \"Task Scheduler\" in the Start Menu.\n\n2.  **Create Basic Task:**\n    *   In the right-hand \"Actions\" pane, click \"Create Basic Task...\".\n    *   **Name:** `GitHub Workspace Backup` (or something descriptive).\n    *   **Description:** `Automatically backs up the workspace to GitHub.`\n    *   Click \"Next\".\n\n3.  **Trigger:**\n    *   Choose \"Daily\" (or \"Hourly\" if you want more frequent backups, keeping in mind the 3-hour wipeout).\n    *   Click \"Next\".\n\n4.  **Daily Trigger:**\n    *   Set the start date and time.\n    *   Set \"Recur every\" to `1` day (or `1` hour if you chose hourly).\n    *   Click \"Next\".\n\n5.  **Action:**\n    *   Select \"Start a program\".\n    *   Click \"Next\".\n\n6.  **Start a Program:**\n    *   **Program/script:** `C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code\\backup.bat`\n    *   **Start in (optional):** `C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code` (This ensures the script runs in the correct directory, though the `cd` command in the script also handles this).\n    *   Click \"Next\".\n\n7.  **Finish:**\n    *   Review the summary.\n    *   Check the box \"Open the Properties dialog for this task when I click Finish\" (this is important for advanced settings).\n    *   Click \"Finish\".\n\n8.  **Configure Advanced Settings (Properties Dialog):**\n    *   In the \"General\" tab:\n        *   Select \"Run whether user is logged on or not\" (this is crucial for unattended backups).\n        *   Check \"Do not store password. The task will only have access to local computer resources.\" (This is fine since SSH keys are used for GitHub).\n        *   Check \"Run with highest privileges\".\n    *   In the \"Conditions\" tab:\n        *   Uncheck \"Start the task only if the computer is on AC power\" (if you want it to run on battery).\n        *   Uncheck \"Start only if the following network connection is available\" (unless you specifically need it).\n    *   Click \"OK\". You might be prompted for your Windows user password.\n\n**Phase 3: Automating Restoration (Cloning on Reboot)**\n\nThis is the trickiest part due to the PC wipeouts. The goal is to clone your repository *after* a reboot.\n\n**Compromised Option for Restoration:**\n\nSince your PC wipes out all content, any script placed in a standard startup folder will also be wiped. This means full automation of restoration on reboot is **not directly possible** without a persistent, non-wiped location for the restoration script.\n\nHere are the compromised options:\n\n1.  **Manual Clone on Reboot (Most Reliable):**\n    *   After each reboot, you would manually open a Git Bash or Command Prompt and run:\n        ```bash\n        git clone git@github.com:hoon9732/devenv_vault.git C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code\n        ```\n    *   This is the most reliable method as it doesn't rely on anything persisting through the wipe.\n\n2.  **External USB Drive / Network Share (If available and persistent):**\n    *   If you have access to a persistent external USB drive or a network share that *doesn't* get wiped, you could store a simple batch script there.\n    *   This script would contain the `git clone` command.\n    *   You would then manually run this script from the persistent location after each reboot.\n\n3.  **Windows Login Script (Requires Group Policy Editor - not always available on Home editions):**\n    *   If your Windows edition has Group Policy Editor (`gpedit.msc`), you *might* be able to configure a login script that runs from a network location or a very specific, non-wiped system location (which is rare for user data). This is more complex and less likely to work given the \"all content\" wipe.\n\n**Recommendation for Restoration:**\n\nGiven your constraints, **manual cloning after reboot (Option 1)** is the most practical and reliable approach. You could even save the `git clone` command in a simple text file on your desktop (if the desktop persists, or on a USB drive) for quick copy-pasting.\n\n**Summary of Current Status:**\n\n*   **Initial Backup:** Your workspace is now a Git repository, linked to `https://github.com/hoon9732/devenv_vault`, and the initial content has been pushed.\n*   **Automated Backups:** The `backup.bat` script is created, and you have instructions to set up a Windows Scheduled Task to run it regularly using SSH authentication.\n*   **Automated Restoration:** Full automation is not feasible due to PC wipeouts. Manual cloning after reboot is the recommended compromised option.\n\nDo you have any questions about setting up the Scheduled Task, or would you like me to help you create a simple text file with the clone command for manual restoration?",

This is necessary because these files might be wiped.\n    *   **You will need to re-add the *newly generated public key* to your GitHub account after each wipeout that affects your `.ssh` directory.** The public key will be in `C:\\Users\\USER\\.ssh\\github_devenv_vault.pub`. This is the main manual step remaining for full automation after a wipe.\n*   **First Run After Wipe:** The very first time the `restore_workspace.bat` script runs after a wipe, it will generate a *new* SSH key. You will then need to manually copy the content of `C:\\Users\\USER\\.ssh\\github_devenv_vault.pub` and add it to your GitHub SSH keys *before* the `git clone` command will succeed. Subsequent runs (if the `.ssh` directory persists) will use the existing key.\n*   **Network Connection:** Ensure your PC has a network connection when the script runs, otherwise, `git clone` will fail.\n*   **Execution Time:** The script will run on login. Depending on the size of your repository, the cloning process might take some time.\n\n**To summarize the complete workflow:**\n\n1.  **Initial Setup (Completed):**\n    *   Git initialized in your workspace.\n    *   GitHub repository `devenv_vault` created and linked.\n    *   Initial workspace content pushed to GitHub.\n    *   SSH key pair generated and public key added to GitHub.\n    *   `~/.ssh/config` updated for GitHub SSH.\n2.  **Automated Backups (Scheduled Task):**\n    *   `backup.bat` created.\n    *   **You need to set up the Windows Scheduled Task** as instructed previously to run `backup.bat` regularly.\n3.  **Automated Restoration (Startup Script):**\n    *   `restore_workspace.bat` created.\n    *   **You need to move/copy `restore_workspace.bat` to your Windows Startup folder.**\n    *   **After a PC wipe that affects your `.ssh` directory, you will need to manually copy the *new* public key from `C:\\Users\\USER\\.ssh\\github_devenv_vault.pub` and add it to your GitHub SSH keys.**\n\nThis setup provides the most automated solution possible given your constraints.
