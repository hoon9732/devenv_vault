      "content": "In the provided C++ code, the variable `a` in the `main` function is not changed from 10 to 20 because `callByVal` uses **call by value**.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Copy is Made:** When `callByVal(a)` is executed, a *copy* of the value of `a` (which is 10) is passed to the `callByVal` function. This copy is stored in the function's local parameter, also named `a`.\n2.  **Local Modification:** Inside `callByVal`, `a = 20;` modifies only this local copy. The original `a` in `main` remains untouched.\n3.  **Scope:** Once `callByVal` finishes, its local variables (including its parameter `a`) are destroyed.\n\nTherefore, when `cout << \"a: \" << a << end;` is executed in `main`, it prints the original value of `a`, which is still 10.",
