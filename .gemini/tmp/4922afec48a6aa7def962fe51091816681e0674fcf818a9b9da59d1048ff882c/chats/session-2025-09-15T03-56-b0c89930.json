You might be asked to confirm your GitHub password.\n\nOnce you've added the SSH key to GitHub, you'll be all set for backing up your workspace.\n\n**To back up your workspace before turning off your PC:**\n\n1.  Open a command prompt or PowerShell.\n2.  Navigate to your project directory: `cd C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code`\n3.  Run the backup script: `sys\\backup.bat`\n\nThis will add all changes, commit them, and push them to your `devenv_vault` repository on GitHub.\n\nLet me know if you need any help with any of these steps!",

      "content": "Yes, this branch structure has meaning, and there's a good reason to consider making `main` your default branch.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   **`master` branch:** Historically, `master` was the default branch name for Git repositories. It typically represented the primary, stable version of the project.\n*   **`main` branch:** In recent years, there's been a widespread move in the software development community to rename the default branch from `master` to `main` for inclusivity reasons. Many new repositories on platforms like GitHub now default to `main`.\n\n**Why make `main` the default?**\n\n1.  **Industry Standard:** `main` is becoming the new standard default branch name. Aligning with this makes your repository more consistent with modern practices.\n2.  **Clarity and Consistency:** If your `backup.bat` is pushing to `main`, and that's where your active development is, it makes sense for `main` to be the default branch on GitHub. This way, when someone visits your repository, they immediately see the most up-to-date version.\n3.  **Simplicity:** Having your active development branch also be your default branch simplifies workflows and reduces potential confusion.\n\n**How to change the default branch on GitHub:**\n\nYou can change the default branch for your `devenv_vault` repository directly on GitHub:\n\n1.  Go to your `devenv_vault` repository on GitHub.\n2.  Click on \"Settings\" (usually near the top right, under the repository name).\n3.  In the left sidebar, click on \"Branches\".\n4.  Next to \"Default branch\", click the pencil icon to edit.\n5.  Select `main` from the dropdown list.\n6.  Click \"Update\".\n\nAfter changing the default branch on GitHub, you won't need to modify your `backup.bat` script, as it already pushes to `main`. This will ensure your backups are always visible on the default branch.",
