Run `pacman -Syu` one more time to make sure all remaining updates are installed.\n\nAfter you've successfully done that, your system will have the correct certificates, and you can try the original installation command again:\n\n`pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain`",

This can happen if the package databases are out of sync. Let's try a more forceful refresh.\n\nRun this command in the MSYS2 terminal:\n\n`pacman -Syyu`\n\n*   The double `y` (`yy`) forces `pacman` to download fresh copies of the package database files, even if it thinks they are up-to-date. This often resolves signature and certificate issues.\n*   The `u` will then perform the system update using these fresh databases.\n\nLike before, you may need to close and reopen the terminal if prompted, and run `pacman -Syu` a final time.\n\n### 2. CLI and MSYS2 Tips\n\nYou've run into two classic terminal behaviors. Here are the solutions:\n\n*   **Ending questions abruptly (Gemini CLI):** To create a new line in this CLI without sending your message, use **`Shift + Enter`**. Pressing `Enter` alone always submits the prompt.\n\n*   **Copying in MSYS2:** You are correct, `Ctrl + C` is the universal \"interrupt\" signal to stop a running program in a terminal. To copy and paste, you have a few options:\n    *   **Keyboard:** Use **`Ctrl + Shift + C`** to copy and **`Ctrl + Shift + V`** to paste.\n    *   **Mouse:** Simply highlight the text you want to copy, then **right-click** with your mouse to paste. (Some terminals copy on highlight and paste on right-click).\n    *   **Menu:** Right-click the terminal's title bar, go to `Edit`, and you will see options for `Copy` and `Paste`.",

The fact that you see similar issues with other `Shift + ...` combinations is the key piece of evidence.\n\nThis is almost certainly not a Gemini CLI issue, but rather a system-level setting or a background program.\n\n### Immediate Workaround\n\nThe most reliable way to input multi-line text will be to:\n1.  Type your full message in a simple text editor (like Notepad).\n2.  Copy the entire block of text.\n3.  Paste it into the CLI prompt.\n\n### Troubleshooting Your Keyboard Settings\n\nHere are the most common culprits for this kind of issue on Windows:\n\n1.  **Sticky Keys or Filter Keys:** These are Windows Accessibility features that can change how modifier keys (like Shift, Ctrl, Alt) behave.\n    *   Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Keyboard**.\n    *   Make sure **Sticky Keys**, **Filter Keys**, and **Toggle Keys** are all turned **OFF**.\n\n2.  **Background Applications:** A running application could be globally capturing keyboard shortcuts. This is common with:\n    *   Hotkey utilities (like AutoHotkey)\n    *   Screen recording or streaming software (like OBS, NVIDIA ShadowPlay)\n    *   Gaming overlays\n    *   Some graphics card control panels\n    *   Check your system tray (the icons by the clock) for any such programs, and try temporarily closing them.\n\n3.  **Keyboard Driver Issues:** You could try reinstalling or updating your keyboard driver via the **Device Manager**.\n\nFor now, please use the copy-paste method.\n\nLet's get back to the compiler. Were you able to run the `pacman -Syyu` command in the MSYS2 terminal? What was the result?",
