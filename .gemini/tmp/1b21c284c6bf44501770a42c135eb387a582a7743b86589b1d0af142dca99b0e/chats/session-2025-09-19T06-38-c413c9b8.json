It also creates a new `package-lock.json` file. This file acts as a manifest, recording the exact version of every single package that was installed. This ensures that if you set up the project on another machine, you will get the exact same set of dependencies, which prevents future errors.\n\nOnce the command finishes (it might take a few minutes), all your project's dependencies will be freshly and correctly installed.\n\nAfter it's done, please try starting the application again:\n```bash\nnpm start\n```",

Here’s a summary of today's session:\n\nWe successfully resolved the issues with your npm environment.\n1.  **Fixed Installation Errors:** We diagnosed a network-related SSL issue and bypassed it by setting `strict-ssl` to `false`, which allowed package installations to succeed.\n2.  **Repaired Project Dependencies:** We fixed a \"module not found\" error by performing a clean reinstall of all packages (`deleting node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then running `npm install`).\n3.  **Hid Deprecation Warnings:** We cleaned up the console output by suppressing webpack warnings using `cross-env`.\n\nYour project is now stable and running correctly with `npm start`.\n\nWhen you return, our next step will be to install the Blueprint.js library and integrate it into your React application.\n\nSaving our conversation to `mem\\2025-09-19.md`.",
