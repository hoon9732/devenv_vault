      "content": "Previously, you have helped me create a 'workspace sidebar', mainly coded in @src/components/SecondarySidebar.js . Which lists files and folders in a selected 'workspace'. But the problem was that the sidebar lags when the sidebar size is changed by dragging the right boundary and when there are too many files and folders on the sidebar. Would there be a way to resource-efficiently render the file and folder list once when the workspace is first loaded, and not bother rendering again in too short intervals? And also, when the sidebar is expanding or shrinking, the topbar icons seem to be changing its place during the animation which is unnecessary. I simply want the graphics to be 'fixed' on the sidebar when it appeears or disappears. In short, i want the sidebar to be sliding left or right, not expanding or shrinking.\n--- Content from referenced files ---\nContent from @C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\code\\blueprint-gui\\src\\components\\SecondarySidebar.js:\nimport React, { useState, useRef, useCallback, useEffect } from 'react';\r\nimport Toolbar from '@mui/material/Toolbar';\r\nimport Box from '@mui/material/Box';\r\nimport Button from '@mui/material/Button';\r\nimport IconButton from '@mui/material/IconButton';\r\nimport Tooltip from '@mui/material/Tooltip';\r\nimport FolderOpenIcon from '@mui/icons-material/FolderOpen';\r\nimport NoteAddIcon from '@mui/icons-material/NoteAdd';\r\nimport CreateNewFolderIcon from '@mui/icons-material/CreateNewFolder';\r\nimport CloseIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Close';\r\nimport MoreVertIcon from '@mui/icons-material/MoreVert';\r\nimport Menu from '@mui/material/Menu';\r\nimport MenuItem from '@mui/material/MenuItem';\r\nimport CheckIcon from '@mui/icons-material/Check';\r\nimport ListItemText from '@mui/material/ListItemText';\r\nimport TextField from '@mui/material/TextField';\r\nimport Dialog from '@mui/material/Dialog';\r\nimport DialogActions from '@mui/material/DialogActions';\r\nimport DialogContent from '@mui/material/DialogContent';\r\nimport DialogContentText from '@mui/material/DialogContentText';\r\nimport DialogTitle from '@mui/material/DialogTitle';\r\nimport { useLanguage } from '../contexts/LanguageContext';\r\nimport TreeView from './TreeView';\r\n\r\nconst initialDrawerWidth = 240;\r\nconst minDrawerWidth = 150;\r\nconst maxDrawerWidth = 500;\r\n\r\nconst SecondarySidebar = ({ open, setOpen, workspacePath, setWorkspacePath }) => {\r\n  const { t } = useLanguage();\r\n  const [drawerWidth, setDrawerWidth] = useState(initialDrawerWidth);\r\n  const [refreshKey, setRefreshKey] = useState(0);\r\n  const [dialogOpen, setDialogOpen] = useState(false);\r\n  const [dialogConfig, setDialogConfig] = useState({ type: '', path: '' });\r\n  const [itemName, setItemName] = useState('');\r\n  const [isResizing, setIsResizing] = useState(false);\r\n  const sidebarRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const [renderTree, setRenderTree] = useState(false);\r\n  const [settingsAnchorEl, setSettingsAnchorEl] = useState(null);\r\n  const [settings, setSettings] = useState({ showIcons: true, showOnStart: false });\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const fetchSettings = async () => {\r\n      if (window.electron) {\r\n        const fetchedSettings = await window.electron.getWorkspaceSettings();\r\n        setSettings(fetchedSettings);\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    fetchSettings();\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    // When closing, unmount the tree immediately to prevent lag\r\n    if (!open) {\r\n      setRenderTree(false);\r\n    }\r\n  }, [open]);\r\n\r\n  const handleOpenWorkspace = async () => {\r\n    if (window.electron) {\r\n      const path = await window.electron.setWorkspacePath();\r\n      if (path) {\r\n        setWorkspacePath(path);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleClose = () => {\r\n    setOpen(false);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const refreshTreeView = () => {\r\n    setRefreshKey(prevKey => prevKey + 1);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleNewItem = (type, path) => {\r\n    setDialogConfig({ type, path: path || workspacePath });\r\n    setDialogOpen(true);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleDialogClose = () => {\r\n    setDialogOpen(false);\r\n    setItemName('');\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleDialogSubmit = async () => {\r\n    if (!itemName) return;\r\n    const { type, path } = dialogConfig;\r\n    const fullPath = `${path}\\${itemName}`;\r\n    let result;\r\n    if (type === 'file') {\r\n      result = await window.electron.createFile(fullPath);\r\n    } else {\r\n      result = await window.electron.createDirectory(fullPath);\r\n    }\r\n    if (result.success) {\r\n      refreshTreeView();\r\n    } else {\r\n      console.error(result.error);\r\n    }\r\n    handleDialogClose();\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleMouseDown = (e) => {\r\n    e.preventDefault();\r\n    setIsResizing(true);\r\n    document.addEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);\r\n    document.addEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  const handleMouseMove = useCallback((e) => {\r\n    if (sidebarRef.current) {\r\n      const newWidth = e.clientX - sidebarRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().left;\r\n      if (newWidth > minDrawerWidth && newWidth < maxDrawerWidth) {\r\n        sidebarRef.current.style.width = `${newWidth}px`;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }, []);\r\n\r\n  const handleMouseUp = () => {\r\n    setIsResizing(false);\r\n    document.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleMouseMove);\r\n    document.removeEventListener('mouseup', handleMouseUp);\r\n    if (sidebarRef.current) {\r\n      const newWidth = parseFloat(sidebarRef.current.style.width);\r\n      setDrawerWidth(newWidth);\r\n      sidebarRef.current.style.width = '';

      "content": "Okay, I understand the performance and visual issues with the workspace sidebar. The lag during resizing and the shifting icons during the open/close animation can certainly be improved.\n\nHere's the plan to address this:\n\n1.  **Fix Shifting Icons:** I'll restructure the component to prevent the content (like the top bar icons) from reflowing when the sidebar opens or closes. This will be achieved by wrapping the sidebar's content in a fixed-width container, ensuring the icons and file tree remain stable during the animation. This will create a smoother \"reveal\" effect instead of a resize.\n2.  **Improve Resizing Performance:** To eliminate the lag when dragging the sidebar's edge, I'll add a subtle overlay to the file tree area during the resize operation. This prevents the browser from constantly re-rendering the entire list of files and folders, making the resizing feel smooth and responsive. I'll also optimize the drag handling logic.\n\nI will now apply these changes to `src/components/SecondarySidebar.js`.",

When the workspace is open, clicking the topbar hamburger button(the real topbar, not the topbar of the workspace sidebar) should not hide the workspace sidebar. The workspace sidebar should stay open regardless of the actions at the primary sidebar or the topbar hamburger button.\n2. The dropdown menu of the settings, and the dropdown menu from right-clicking the folder or file has too large font, not matching the theme of the workspace at all. I have previously discussed this issue with you, but was not able to truly fix it. Even though you matched the font size with the font of the files, the dropdown menu text and spacing was always still larger. What could be the problem? I want all the dropdown menus to be rectangular and have small text and interval as in the file-folder structure."

I'll fix this by preventing the app from saving settings on the very first render.\n2.  **Fix Profile Language Bug:** The profile button likely stops working in Korean because it's passing a translated string as an identifier. I'll modify it to use a fixed, language-independent key.\n3.  **Adjust Profile Styling:** I'll reduce the text size within the profile modal and left-align the fields (except for the name) to improve the layout and ensure it scales properly.\n4.  **Increase Dropdown Margin:** I'll add a bit more vertical padding to the dropdown menu items to improve their spacing.\n\nFirst, I'll fix the settings persistence issue in `App.js`.",
