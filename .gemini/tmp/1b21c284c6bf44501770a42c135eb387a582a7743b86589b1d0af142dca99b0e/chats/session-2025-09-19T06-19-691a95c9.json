Setting `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` as an environment variable in the running application and then cleaning up the `node_modules` and cache is next to ensure consistent state. I plan on testing this fix before recommending a clean slate approach. I'll need to remember that Windows has different commands from macOS and Linux.\n\nMy primary focus is now on confirming that the SSL issue is indeed the underlying cause of the communication loop. If this approach fixes it, I'll advise an action for the user. I'll implement these changes for testing and look at implementing the fix if the test is successful.",
