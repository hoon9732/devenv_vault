Delete the `node_modules` folder.\n2.  Delete the `package-lock.json` file.\n3.  Open a command prompt or terminal in your project's root directory.\n4.  Run the command: `npm install`\n\nThis forces npm to re-download and reinstall all the project dependencies from scratch, based on your `package.json` file.\n\nI can also create a batch file to automate this for you.

The \"fundamental\" way to fix this is to update `react-scripts` to a newer version that uses the updated `setupMiddlewares` option instead of the deprecated ones.\n\nI'll check your `package.json` to see which version you're using and if a newer one is available.\n\n### 2. Unused Code Warning\n\nIt's strange that the unused code warning is still showing up after I commented out the lines.

This unpacks all the hidden configurations (like webpack) into your project. You could then manually fix the deprecated options. The major downside is that you lose the simplicity of `react-scripts` and have to manage a complex build setup yourself.\n2.  **Migrate:** Move to a different, more actively maintained framework like Vite or Next.js. This is a significant undertaking.\n3.  **Suppress the warning:** For now, this is the most practical option. We can tell Node.js to hide deprecation warnings.\n\nGiven the complexity of the other options, I recommend we suppress the warnings for now. I can modify your `electron:start` script in `package.json` to do this.\n\nAs for the \"no-unused-vars\" warning, could you please try stopping and restarting the development server (`npm run electron:start`)?

This style will be dynamically updated based on the `uiScale` state, ensuring the entire UI scales up or down proportionally, just like a browser zoom.\n\n3.  **Pass State to Settings**: I'll pass the `uiScale` state and its setter function down as props to the `SettingsScreen` component.\n\n4.  **Add a Slider Control**: In `SettingsScreen.js`, I'll add an MUI `Slider` component. This slider will be connected to the `uiScale` state, allowing you to change the scale by dragging it. I'll also add a label to show the current scale percentage.\n\nThis will give you a smooth, interactive way to control the UI size from within your application's settings.\n\nDoes this plan sound good to you?",

The profile popup should have small edit button on the upper right for editing current profile. Clicking the button should make texts editable, and also make the profile logo editable. Clicking the profile logo(would show tranparent overlay of edit button on it when mouse hovers over it.) will create a square pallette to the side with different profile logo options(placed in 3x3 array, total 9 icons as an example). The saved profile should be saved as a .json format credential in a separate folder 'profile' in the workspace, with default profile already saved in the start."

After the workspace is chosen, the secondary sidebar should work as an in-app file explorer as in modern vscode app. The folders and files should be shown in icons and names, and should be structured as a list. They should be collapsable by clicking '>' or 'V' shaped icons left of the left of the file/folder icon as in vscode.\n3. After any workspace is loaded, there should be a small topbar of icons on top of the secondary sidebar(now called \"explorer sidebar\") which has icons for 'open new workspace', 'create new file', 'create new folder'(but they have icons only), and a simple close 'x' button to the very right of the explorer sidebar which closes it(but the workspace setting always remains. even after the app is turned off!) which does exactly what it says, just as in vscode.\n4. clicking the \"App\" buttons in the primary sidebar will not collapse the explorer sidebar.

This is crucial because the React code can't access the file system directly.\n    *   These handlers will:\n        *   Get and set the workspace path, saving it persistently in a configuration file.\n        *   Read the contents of a directory to build the file tree.\n        *   Handle creating new files and folders (as placeholders for now).\n    *   I'll expose these new functions to the React app via `preload.js`.\n\n2.  **State Management (`App.js`)**:\n    *   I'll introduce a new state to hold the current `workspacePath`. This will be loaded from the config file when the app starts.\n    *   I'll refactor the logic for opening and closing the secondary sidebar. Its visibility will now be independent of app navigation and only controlled by the \"Workspace\" button and a new close button.\n\n3.  **Primary Sidebar (`Sidebar.js`)**:\n    *   I'll change the styling of the \"App\" buttons to have colored icons instead of colored backgrounds, as you requested.\n\n4.  **Explorer Sidebar (`SecondarySidebar.js`)**:\n    *   This component will be completely overhauled.\n    *   It will now conditionally render either the \"Open Workspace\" button (if no workspace is set) or the full file explorer view.\n    *   I'll add the new top bar with icon buttons for \"Open Workspace\", \"New File\", \"New Folder\", and \"Close\".\n    *   I will create a new, recursive `TreeView` component to render the collapsible file and folder structure, mimicking the VS Code experience.\n\nI'll start with the foundational step: adding the necessary backend logic to the Electron main process.",
