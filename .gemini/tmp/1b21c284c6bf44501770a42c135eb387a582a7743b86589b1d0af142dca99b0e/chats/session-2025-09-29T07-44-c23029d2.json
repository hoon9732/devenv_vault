This will ensure the heavy `TreeView` component only renders after the sidebar's opening animation is fully complete, which should make it much smoother. When closing, I'll keep the current behavior of removing the tree immediately to prevent lag.\n\n**For the stuck sidebar (Bug 2):**\n\nThe issue is how inline styles from resizing interact with the component's state and CSS transitions. I'll refactor the resizing logic. The inline style will now be removed as soon as you finish dragging, and the sidebar's width will be managed cleanly through React state. This prevents the inline style from interfering with the closing animation.\n\n**For the styling adjustment:**\n\nI'll check the font size used in the `TreeView.js` component for file and folder names, and then apply that same font size to the settings menu items to ensure they match.\n\nI'll start by reading `src/components/TreeView.js` to get the font size.",
