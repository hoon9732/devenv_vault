This is because a static padding was applied to every item to create a basic indentation. The correct approach, which I will implement, is to apply padding dynamically based on the item's depth in the tree. This will remove the unnecessary margin from the top-level items and create a proper, hierarchical indentation for nested files and folders.\n\n2.  **Resizing Lag:** My previous fix improved things, but the fundamental issue is a conflict between the sidebar's CSS animation (`transition`) and the direct style manipulation from the drag event. The browser is trying to smoothly animate the width while JavaScript is forcing an update on every pixel of mouse movement, causing stuttering. I'll fix this by disabling the CSS transition during the resize operation and re-enabling it once you're done dragging. This should make the resizing feel native and instantaneous.\n\nI'll start by applying the performance fix to `SecondarySidebar.js`.",

The application is trying to render a potentially huge file tree *at the same time* it's trying to animate the sidebar, causing the stutter and unexpected visual artifacts.\n\nYou are right to expect better. I'll fix this by completely separating the animation from the rendering.\n\nHere is my plan:\n1.  **Decouple Rendering from Animation:** I will modify the sidebar so that when you open it, it animates first as an empty container, and only when the animation is finished does it render the (potentially very large) file tree. When you close it, the file tree will be removed *immediately*, and the empty container will animate closed. This ensures the animations are always fast and fluid, regardless of the workspace size.\n2.  **Fix the UI Glitch:** This new rendering logic will also fix the visual glitch you're seeing. The \"ghost\" elements are appearing because the old logic was trying to unmount the tree *after* the animation, which was clearly failing.\n3.  **Redesign the Settings Menu:** I will significantly tighten the design of the settings menu, reducing its padding, margins, and font size to perfectly match the compact style of the file list, as you requested.\n\nI will begin by implementing the performance and rendering fix in `SecondarySidebar.js`.",

When the sidebar opens, it will animate first, and the file tree will only render *after* the animation is complete. When it closes, the tree will be removed *instantly*, allowing the now-empty sidebar to animate smoothly without any stutter or visual artifacts. This will resolve both the lag and the bug where the sidebar fails to close correctly.\n\n2.  **Fix the Settings Menu Styling:** I will meticulously adjust the settings menu's styling to match your request. I'll read the file tree's styles to get the exact font size and apply it to the menu text. I will also remove all extra vertical margins from the dropdown to ensure it sits flush and is as compact as possible.\n\nI'll begin by applying the critical performance and bug fix to `SecondarySidebar.js`.",

When the sidebar closes, the folder and filename text, and even the icons are all animated during the closing phase, which may be the cause of the immense lag during the closing animation. skip this unnecessary rendering process when closing.\n3.

The new logic is simple and robust: when you close the sidebar, the file tree will be unmounted *instantly*. The animation will then run on a simple, empty container, making it fluid and fast regardless of workspace size. When opening, the reverse will happen: the empty container will animate first, and the file tree will only render after the animation is complete.\n3.  **Fix the Settings Style:** I will reduce the font size in the settings menu to `0.8rem` to visually match the file names, as requested.\n\nI will now apply all of these fixes to `SecondarySidebar.js`.

I'll make the `renderTree` be `false` immediately after the drawer starts closing, and true after a delay when it opens. I'll also remove the `<Collapse>` component.\n2.  **Fix Closing Bug:** I'm making a more robust `handleClose` method that should set inline `width` to auto, and then setting `open` to `false` in that order.",

Second, the sidebar gets stuck and won't close if you resize it by dragging the edge first.
