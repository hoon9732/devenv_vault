Pricing varies depending on the specific model you use (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. Flash).\n*   **Cost Management:** You can optimize costs by using batch APIs for non-real-time tasks and by writing token-efficient prompts.\n\nTo understand your specific limits and costs, you'll need to check your billing details in the **Google Cloud Console**.",
