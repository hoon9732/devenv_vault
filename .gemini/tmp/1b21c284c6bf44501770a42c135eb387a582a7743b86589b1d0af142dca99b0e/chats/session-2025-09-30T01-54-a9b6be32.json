      "content": "Of course. The performance issue you're describing is a classic problem when rendering large lists or trees of data in React. Your intuition is correct: the entire file tree is likely being rendered at once, which causes significant lag during operations that affect the sidebar's size or visibility, like resizing, opening, or closing.\n\nThe most effective solution for this is **virtualization**, which means only rendering the items that are currently visible to the user. However, this requires changes to the `TreeView` component itself.\n\nAs a first step, I can implement a quick fix in `SecondarySidebar.js` to solve the most immediate problem: the severe lag when resizing the sidebar. My approach will be to temporarily hide the tree's content while you are dragging the resize handle. This will make the resizing action smooth and responsive. Once you release the mouse, the content will reappear.\n\nHere is the change:",

The most likely culprit is the `height` property, which is initialized to `0` and then updated by the `ResizeObserver`. It seems `react-window` has an internal bug and cannot handle an initial height of `0`.\n\nTo fix this, I will remove the complex `ResizeObserver` logic and instead use a simpler and more robust CSS-based approach to make the list fill its container.

After re-examining the library's documentation, I've realized the root cause: **`react-window` requires the component used for each row to be wrapped in `React.memo`.** This is a strict requirement that allows the library to avoid re-rendering every single item when the list scrolls.
