Here’s a practical, vendor-clean blueprint that will scale from “browse raw JSON/XML for hundreds of components” to “interactive diagrams + 3D twin + Zettelkasten graph + global search,” without locking you into any Palantir stack.

1) Overall approach (schema-first + modular UI)

a) Normalize → Index → Visualize.

1. Ingest JSON/XML as-is, convert to an internal canonical schema (keep originals, don’t destructively transform).


2. Index both canonical fields and raw blobs for search/links.


3. Visualize through a plugin-ish UI where each view (table, diagram, 3D, graph, editor) gets data via the same typed contracts.



b) Contracts first.
Define types once (Protobuf or JSON Schema) for: Component, Interface, Signal, Connector, Message, DocumentLink, Relation. Generate TS/Python/C# types.

c) Closed-loop.
Every view supports: search → inspect → edit/propose change → validate → version/approve → publish. Store diffs and provenance.

2) Recommended stack (clean, proven pieces)

Frontend (TypeScript)

Shell & widgets: Blueprint.js (dense enterprise UI; Table/Tree/Drawer/Omnibar/Hotkeys).

Interactive diagrams (interface and topology): React Flow (+ elkjs for auto-layout).

3D model viewer + overlays: three.js via React Three Fiber; annotate with HTML overlays or canvas sprites; ingest glTF.

Zettelkasten graph (concept map of specs/notes): react-force-graph or Cytoscape.js (both good for linking notes ↔ components ↔ signals).

File structure editor: a virtualized Tree (Blueprint) + a Monaco editor (for JSON/XML) in a Drawer/Dialog; add YAML/JSON schema validation and XPath previews.

Charts (optional): visx / Recharts for quick plots embedded in Drawers.


Backend

Primary API:

.NET 8 (C#) or Python FastAPI—pick based on your team.

REST + WebSocket (or gRPC if you need streaming/binary).


Storage:

PostgreSQL as the system of record.

Canonical objects in relational tables; flexible parts in JSONB columns.

Keep original XML/JSON in an “artifacts” table/object store with hash + provenance.


Search:

OpenSearch/Elasticsearch (enterprise) or SQLite FTS5/Typesense (simple) for titles, IDs, XPath/JSONPath hits, and notes.


Indexers/parsers:

Python workers (Celery/RQ) to ingest/validate XML→JSON, extract signals/fields, compute diffs, generate thumbnails.


Auth & audit:

RBAC claims in JWT; every change creates an append-only event + snapshot for quick reads.




---

3) Data model (minimal, extensible)

Canonical core (pseudo-TS):

type Id = string;  // ulid/uuid
type Version = string; // e.g., semver

interface Component {
  id: Id;
  name: string;
  kind: "ECU"|"Sensor"|"Actuator"|"Harness"|"Software"|"Assembly";
  tags: string[];
  interfaces: Id[];         // list of Interface ids
  relations: Relation[];    // typed edges to other components
  metadata: Record<string, any>; // passthrough attrs
  version: Version;
}

interface Interface {
  id: Id;
  componentId: Id;
  category: "Electrical"|"Data";
  // electrical
  pins?: Pin[];
  // data
  messages?: Message[];
  documents?: DocRef[];
  version: Version;
}

interface Pin { name: string; net?: string; voltage?: number; gauge?: string; }
interface Message { name: string; bus: "CAN"|"LIN"|"FlexRay"|"Ethernet"; idHex?: string; signals: Signal[]; }
interface Signal { name: string; type: "uint"|"float"|"enum"|"bool"|"bitfield"; bits?: {offset:number; width:number}; unit?: string; min?: number; max?: number; }

interface Relation { type: "connectsTo"|"dependsOn"|"containedIn"|"references"; target: Id; note?: string; }
interface DocRef { kind: "xml"|"json"|"pdf"|"dbc"|"arxml"; sha256: string; path: string; }

This gives every view something consistent to read, while still linking back to raw artifacts.


---

4) UI composition (how each feature fits)

A) Interactive diagrams (system & ICD)

Use React Flow for the canvas: nodes = Components/Interfaces; edges = Relation or message routes.

Auto-layout with elkjs; allow manual pinning + saved layouts.

Edge/Node click → open a Blueprint Drawer with the ICD table (Blueprint Table) for that node.


B) 3D model viewer with data overlay

Load glTF assemblies; map Component.id ↔ mesh.name or metadata.

Use React Three Fiber; show HTML overlays (Blueprint Tag, Callout) positioned with project() to screen space.

Click a mesh → highlight; open Drawer with E-ICD/D-ICD details; show live values (if you stream telemetry later).


C) File structure edit

Left Tree bound to repository paths; right Monaco editor for JSON/XML with schema or XSD validation.

Provide “Propose change” → run validators → create a versioned snapshot → send to review.

Context menu actions: rename, move, link to Component/Interface.


D) Zettelkasten-style knowledge graph

Nodes: Note + any domain objects (Component/Interface/Signal/Doc).

Edges: typed backlinks (e.g., “explains”, “cites”, “contradicts”).

Implement quick capture: Ctrl+Enter from any Drawer to create a Note pre-linked to what you’re viewing.


E) Easy global search

Omnibar (Ctrl/Cmd+K) wired to the search index.

Query across: names/IDs, tags, message IDs, signal names, units, JSON paths ($.payload.*), XPath results for XML.

Filters in the left rail: Kind, Bus, Unit, Safety class, Updated by, Last updated.



---

5) Validation, versioning & diff (crucial for ICDs)

Schema validation: JSON Schema for canonical objects; XSD or schema scripts for XML.

Semantic versioning for each Interface; block breaking changes unless flagged with a migration note.

Diff views:

Table diff for messages/signals (Added/Changed/Removed with Tag colors).

JSON diff (pretty/inline) for raw artifacts.

Graph diff (highlight added/removed nodes/edges).


Workflows: Draft → Review → Approved → Published. Keep an audit event per transition.



---

6) Performance knobs (so it feels snappy)

Virtualize: gallery lists, tables, trees.

Code-split heavy views (3D, diagrams) behind lazy routes; render thumbnails in the gallery.

Client caches per view + ETags.

Precompute thumbnails (PNG) and diagram layouts in background workers.



---

7) Security & deployment (industrial reality)

On-prem / air-gapped capable: Postgres + API + file store behind your firewall.

RBAC: read/write by domain (powertrain, avionics…), per artifact type (ICD, harness, notes).

Policy hooks: custom validators that must pass before approve/publish (e.g., voltage/range checks, enum coverage).

Release channels: dev/stage/prod with feature flags; audit all edits.



---

8) Build it in slices (MVP → advanced)

MVP (2–4 weeks)

1. Load registry (Components/Interfaces) from sample JSON/XML; persist to Postgres.


2. Frontend shell (Blueprint): left filters, center table/tiles, right Drawer.


3. D-ICD table view (Blueprint Table) + Omnibar search.


4. File viewer (Tree + read-only Monaco).


5. Basic diff (Added/Changed/Removed) and version history.



Phase 2

React Flow system diagram (select → Drawer); Saved layouts.

3D viewer (glTF) with pick & overlay badges.

Notes graph (Zettelkasten) + backlinks.

Edit/propose in Monaco + validators + review workflow.


Phase 3

Full-text/OpenSearch; XPath/JSONPath indexing.

Live overlays (WebSocket) for telemetry; time-series panels.

Importers for DBC/ARXML; exporters (CSV/JSON/ARXML).



---

9) Example API edges (clean & minimal)

GET /components?query=...&tag=...

GET /interfaces/{id}/icd (canonical)

GET /artifacts/{sha} (raw file)

POST /edits (propose), POST /reviews/{id}/approve

GET /diffs/{a}..{b}?type=icd|graph|raw

GET /search?q=...&kinds=component,signal,note (with facets)



---

10) Why this works

Schema-first keeps JSON/XML wildness under control.

Modular views let you add 3D/graphs later without touching the core.

Blueprint shell gives you the enterprise ergonomics (dense tables, drawers, omnibar, hotkeys).

Search + notes turn a spec warehouse into a navigable knowledge system.

Versioned, audited edits make it production-safe.


If you want, I can spin up a starter project outline (Vite + TS + Blueprint + React Flow + R3F placeholders), plus a tiny ingest script that converts an example XML/JSON into the canonical objects and prebuilds thumbnails/layouts.
